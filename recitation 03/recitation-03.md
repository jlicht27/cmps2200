In this recitation, we will investigate recurrences for work and span of algorithms.

## Tree method (7.5 pts)
Solve the following recurrences using the tree method.

a) $W(n) = 3W(n/4) + n^2$

Find answers to all problems in answers.pdf

b) $W(n) = W(n/3)+ W(2n/3) + n \log n$

## Brick method (7.5 pts)
Solve the following recurrences using the brick method. First argue
whether they are root-dominated, leaf-dominated, or balanced. Then,
state the resulting asymptotic bound for $W(n)$.

a) $W(n) = 2 W(0.49 n) + 1.01 n$

b) $W(n) = W(n/2) + W(n/4) + 0.999n$

c) $W(n) = \sqrt{n}W(\sqrt{n}) + \sqrt{n}$
